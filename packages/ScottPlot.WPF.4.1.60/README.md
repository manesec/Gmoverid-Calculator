**ScottPlot is a free and open-source plotting library for .NET** that makes it easy to interactively display large datasets. This package provides a WPF control for interactive manipulation of ScottPlot plots.

## WPF Quickstart

Add a `WpfPlot` to your window and give it a unique name:

```xml
<WpfPlot Name="WpfPlot1" />
```

Add the following to your start-up sequence:

```cs
double[] dataX = new double[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
double[] dataY = new double[] { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 };
WpfPlot1.Plot.AddScatter(dataX, dataY);
```

## ScottPlot Cookbook

The [**ScottPlot Cookbook**](https://scottplot.net/cookbook/4.1/) demonstrates how to create line plots, bar charts, pie graphs, scatter plots, and more with just a few lines of code.
